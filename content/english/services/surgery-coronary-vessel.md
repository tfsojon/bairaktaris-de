The surgery of the coronary vessels has been established internationally during the last decades as a method of treating coronary artery disease, along with other therapeutical strategies such as angioplasty (balloon) or/and stent implantation. Today, it corresponds to 60 – 70% of the full range of cardiac surgery. Except for the conventional aortocoronary (using venous grafts) bypasses, it includes a series of other modern innovative therapeutic selections. The range of our clinics includes all the sectors of modern coronary vessel surgery.

- Conventional aortocoronary bypass (Coronary artery bypass surgery) with a heart-lung bypass machine.
- Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB).
- Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB).
- Complete arterial reperfusion of the myocardium.
- Hybrid procedures (combination of bypass procedure and cardiological intervention with cardiac catheterization).

### Conventional aortocoronary bypass using vein grafts (ACVB) and cardiopulmonary bypass device

This procedure is realized with general anesthesia, and it is one of the standard procedures in our clinic for coronary bypass surgery. After opening the sternum, cardiac arrest is provoked by administering a special cardioplegic solution, while the heart-lung bypass machine maintains the circulation and the patient’s supply with oxygen. After the placement of the grafts, the better-perfused heart retrieves its function again. The left internal thoracic artery is used as a graft, and the patient’s veins are from the inner side of the thigh and the calf. In our clinic, the vein grafts are created endoscopically or using minimally interventional techniques to minimize infections and healing disorders and an excellent esthetic result.

### ΟPCAB (Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass)

It concerns a surgical technique during which the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass device is not needed. With the help of stabilizing instruments, the target vessels are stabilized, and then they are bypassed with vein or arterial grafts. Avoiding the use of a heart-lung bypass machine is related to a significantly lower risk for stroke. It is preferred for patients with recent infarct or coexisting pulmonary and/or renal function disorders.

### MIDCAB (Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass)

This technique is a variation of the OPCAB technique, and it is applied in patients with coronary disease localized in the anterior cardiac wall. As a graft, the internal thoracic artery is usually used. The surgical access is realized through a small anterolateral section on the left side, 6 – 8 cm approximately in length. The use of a heart-lung bypass machine is also not necessary here.

### Complete arterial reperfusion of the myocardium

In this technique, exclusively arterial grafts are used. In contrast with the veins, the wall of the arteries has a more robust muscular layer. In this way, they can adapt better to the existing flow conditions and remain passable for a more extended period. As arterial grafts, the internal thoracic and radial arteries are used.

### Hybrid procedures

The hybrid procedures consist of combinative surgical bypass and cardiac catheterization procedures. They are performed in close cooperation with the Department of Cardiology. The patients with indications for hybrid interventions are presented in the scientific council, where the procedure that will be followed is discussed.
