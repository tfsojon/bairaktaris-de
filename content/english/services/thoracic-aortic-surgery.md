### Range of treatment – Aortic surgery

- Replacement of ascending aorta with a composite tubular valve-graft and re -
  implantation of coronary vessels.
- Replacement of ascending aorta using David procedure, with preservation of the
  aortic valve.
- Insertion of “elephant trunk” prosthesis into descending thoracic aorta.
- Partial or complete replacement of aortic arch.
- Supracoronal replacement of the ascending and descending aorta and the aortic
  arch with hybrid implant.

Surgery of aortic root is an important therapeutic sector of our clinic. Apart
from the accomplishment of all the standard replacement techniques concerning
the aortic root, including the D. Ross procedure, the reconstructive techniques
are especially established, with preservation of the aortic valve (T. David
procedure). Because of the possibility to avoid the administration of
anticoagulants, this method is particularly used in patients with Marfan’s
syndrome, while it is used more and more often in patients with acute dissection
of thoracic aorta. The above-mentioned techniques are particularly recommended
to young female patients who wish to get pregnant.

The development of new surgical techniques improves the surgical results, aiming
to the improvement of the patient’s post-operative life quality. New implants
(the so-called hybrid implants), which are connected with a conventional
vascular implant, are used for the replacement of the ascending aorta, aortic
arch and the descending aorta. By this way, an additional surgical intervention
can be avoided for many patients.

The hybrid implant consists of a related stent part and a classical part of
tissue implant. In case of an aneurysm that affects either the aortic arch or
the descending aorta, the descending aorta is replaced by the stent and the
aortic arch (if needed, the ascending aorta too) by the part of tissue of the
implant. In this part, the vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the brain and
the upper extremities are re-implanted. During the procedure, which should be
performed using a heart-lung bypass machine, blood and oxygen is supplied to the
brain with separate catheters.
